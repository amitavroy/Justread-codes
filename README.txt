This is the set of modules that I have talked about in Justread section of the site.

Right now, working on creating a custom display formatter which will use jcarousel to create a gallery with the set of images upload on a specific image field which needs to be more than one for the gallery to get created.

Also want to add the functionality to have themes for the formatter so that different themes can be switched easily when made live. Will be controlled through CSS.
